I utilized Kaggle datasets and employ MySQL for data cleaning, followed by exporting the refined data to Power BI for detailed reporting. My analysis covers:

1. Identifying the month with the highest pizza orders.
2. Determining the most popular pizza type.
3. Pinpointing the peak order times during the day.
4. Highlighting the day with the highest sales.
5. Analyzing the specific time periods with the most sales on peak days.

These insights reveal significant trends and patterns in pizza ordering behavior, aiding strategic decision-making.
